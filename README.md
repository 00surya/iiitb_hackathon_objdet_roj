# IITB Qualcomm Vision-x Hackathon - Object Detection Applications

This repository contains multiple object detection applications developed for the **Qualcomm Vision-x** organized by **IITB**. The focus of these projects is to demonstrate the versatility of computer vision techniques in solving real-world problems using object detection models, specifically YOLOv8. 

Each project within this repository showcases a unique use case where object detection plays a critical role in enabling automation, safety, and data analysis.

## Projects:

### 1. **Vehicle Tracking and Path Analysis** (Primary Project): [Project Vehicle Tracking](https://github.com/00surya/iitb_hackathon_objdet_roj/tree/master/Project_Vehicle_Tracking)
A real-time vehicle tracking system that uses YOLOv8 for vehicle detection and Kalman filtering for trajectory prediction. The system tracks vehicles, analyzes their paths, and estimates their speed based on calibrated real-world points. Erratic driving behaviors are detected and logged for further analysis.

### 2. Helmet Detection
This idea focuses on developing a helmet detection system that uses image processing and machine learning to improve safety in high-risk environments. It ensures real-time monitoring and compliance with helmet-wearing protocols, reducing accidents and promoting safety.


### Note on Documentation

For each project, detailed documentation and instructions are provided in the respective README.md files within their individual project directories. These documents provide insights on how to set up, run, and customize the applications, along with any specific dependencies and configurations for each use case.****
